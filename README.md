# Tp-AySO-Grupo-2

## Functionality of the files
- Dockerfile: creates a nginx image and copies the index.html file in the required path (usr/share)
- namespace.yml: Creates a namespace named: tp-ayso-grupo-2
- deployment.yml: Creates a deployment with one replica uploading the Dockerfile image from our Docker Hub repository. It also uses the namespace.yml
- index.html: creates a h1 with the following text: "Hola Mundo, somos el grupo 2 de la UTN"

- Considerations: We did what we could with the knowledge that we have and searched on the internet. It's not the best but at least we tried to make something that works. Hopefully we will improve it any time soon.
